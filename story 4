when tim and james see that restaurant and first thing comto their mind is there going to open a cake shop after entering that shop they think about challenges to face when they open the restaurant. 
after that interaction they are going to see other parts of the restaurant and the toilet by themselves and the tim is so obsessed with the hotel business but james tryes to play safe and just want to walk away from the restaurant and just see the town in the toilet tim says no matter what he is going to buy this hotel which led to broke between their friendship and they will face so many difficulties.
